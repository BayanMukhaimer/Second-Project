##  App Name & Description

**TuneNest** is a dynamic music playlist application that allows users to build and manage their personal playlists. Inspired by Spotify‚Äôs aesthetic and usability, TuneNest provides a sleek, user-friendly interface where music lovers can:

- Create and name custom playlists
- Add songs to those playlists
- View playlist details and covers
- Upload a custom cover image or automatically use the first song‚Äôs album art
- Log in securely and have personal playlists stored to their account

###  Why I Built It

I created TuneNest to learn how to combine front-end creativity with back-end functionality. This project gave me the opportunity to implement full-stack development techniques including file uploads, session-based auth, and dynamic content rendering using EJS. I was also inspired by how music apps like Spotify engage users visually and emotionally through sleek design ‚Äî so I aimed to capture that experience.
